# THIS IS AN OLD VERSION OF DOCUMENT ACER!!!
This is an older version of Document Acer.
If I haven't published a newer version in a different repository, it means I am still working on it.
Document Acer is one of those special projects to me, and I want to make it even better.
If you want to use the new Document Acer, please wait for me to finish it.

# Document Acer
## What is Document Acer?
Document Acer is a domain specific language (DSL) for creating documents created by EllioAce as a small project that did not turn out small at all.

## How do you use Document Acer
Included with this repository is main.py and compile.bat, they both do the same thing, idk why I made a compile.bat file, all it does is run main.py.
You need the following Python libraries:
1. Pillow

## How do I add images, and why is the example index.acedoc trying to find "quandaledingle.jpg"
First of all, please don't ask why it's looking for "quandaledingle.jpg"...

Anyway, to add images, just place the images in the images directory, "quandaledingle.jpg" isn't included with this repository, so you can just add a new image, then change the image in the code to look for the image you added.

## Is there a documentation?
I can't unfortunately provide one at the moment, but perhaps in the future.
But the example code in index.acedoc should give you a good idea of how to code a document.

## **_Please_ take note**
I do not recommend using Document Acer for formal document creation in its current state, it cannot export to .pdf or any other format that normal documents are exported in, it can only be exported to a .png file at the moment.
